#Background 
What is the L5PC Neuron -- 2/3 of the mammilian cortex critical for cogniitive processing 

Purpose -- many computational models use HH to represent a L5PC neuron -- is this accurate? can we optimize stimulation of such neuron to get desired activity while decreasing cost on tissues? -- dementia applicatoins 

#Computational Methods


Final Project for computational physics.
